## Skilly App

### Requirements
1. Nodejs
2. Aws Account
3. [Amplify cli](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/)

### Background
Skilly is an application that allows you to create a registry of your employees.
You can also store useful information such as their address and what skills they may have.

### Architecture
Skilly uses React and Material Design for the front-end.
Apollo and GraphQL are used for API interaction, and Amazon's DynamoDB for data storage.

## Running Locally
### Creating the API
This project was intended to be used with an Amplify Framework.
Here is a good video to show you how to get an Amplify API up and running.
